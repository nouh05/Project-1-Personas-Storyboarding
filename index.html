      <h2>1. Interface</h2>
      <p>The interface that I chose was a self service checkout machine at
        the grocery store.
      </p>
      <h2>2. Sketch and Description of Interface</h2>

      <p>
        The sketch above is of a typical self service chekcout at a grocery store.
        One of the problems with the checkout station is that the barcode reader 
        can be sensitive and require items to be perfectly placed which can leave 
        users frustrated. It is also not always clear which side of the machine is 
        the bagging station which can cause errors with the machine. The main components
        are the main screen. This screen has all of the instructions step by step. It is 
        often touch screen, and you can select things like how many bags you used, payment
        method, whether or not you want your receipt, etc. There is a barcode scanner 
        underneath the main screen, and each item you have scanned pops up on the screen 
        so that you can keep track of your purchases. one= either side of the machine 
        there is a bagging station, and then a station where your scanned items go. 
        There is also a credit card reader, often next to the main screen. Typically the 
        user will just scan their items, then they can select finish and pay, and then 
        select their payment method, and then finally pay for their items.

      <h2>3. Observations and Interview Summaries From 3 Users</h2>
      <h3>Questions: </h3>
      <p>1. What made you go to the self checkout as opposed to the manual checkout?<br>
        2. Did you use the bagging station?<br>
        3. How would you describe your overall experience using the product?<br>
        4. Was there any aspect about the product that was difficult to use?<br>
        5. What would you improve about the product?<br>
      </p>
      <h3>Answers</h3>
      <ul><li>Users went to the self checkout line as opposed to the regular one because the lines 
        for the regular one were long, and the people in them had a lot of items. Self checkout
        was deemed to be much more efficient.</li>
        <li>There was a mix on whether the users used the bagging station depending on whether they brought
          their own bags or not. Users who brought their own bags tended to now use the station and vice versa.
        </li>
        <li>
          The overall experience was described as positive generally. Users found the machine easy to use and thought
          the instructions on the main screen were helpful.
        </li>
        <li>
          Overall scanning the barcodes were described as being the most difficult aspect ot use.
          This is because some items did not have barcodes, or they were awkward postions on the item to scan,
          and the machine could not register them.
        </li>
        <li>
          It was recommended that larger barcodes be placed onto items, or the process be made more clear for dealing 
          with items without bar codes. Also it should be clearly indicated which side of the machine the items should go once they are 
          scanned. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Observations:</h3>
      <p>All of the users had to scan the barcodes, however many struggled to find the
        barcode on an item, or the machine required it to be placed in a very specific manner
        which many users took multiple tries to accomplish. Some users were able to scan their 
        items and then place them into the bagging area without issue. However, others either 
        placed them on the wrong side of the machine, or did not wish to use a bag and were unaware
        that they needed to press the skip bagging button, which caused visible frustration because 
        the machine would not scan their next item.

          Isabella Chung has picked up a few groceries after work in order to make dinner
          for herself. Isabella forgot her reusable bags, so she was forced to use the bags 
          provided by the store, and unfortunately she ran into trouble because there was 
          no more space in the bagging area. Thus the machine did not let her scan the next item due 
          to her not putting the previous item away correctly in the bagging area. This represents the users
          because multiple users needed to have an employee help them due to not putting their items away correctly in the 
          bagging area.

          Michael Dadzie is having a barbeque and needed to do some shopping to prepare for it. 
          unfortunately, some of the items that he was buying did not have bar codes on them, and he was not sure how to proceed.
          Also, some items that did have bar codes, either had ones that were too small, or were in difficult places to scan.
          This represents the users because numerous users had to get assistance from employees, or were visibly upset
          due to takin a long time trying to get items to scan.
